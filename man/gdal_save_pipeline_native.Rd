\title{Save GDAL Pipeline Using Native GDALG Format Driver}
\usage{
gdal_save_pipeline_native(pipeline, path, overwrite = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline}{A gdal_pipeline or gdal_job object with pipeline}

\item{path}{Character string specifying output path (typically .gdalg.json)}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites existing file}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints diagnostic information}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path where pipeline was saved
}
\description{
Saves a gdal_pipeline using the native GDALG format. This method produces
pure GDALG JSON that is compatible with GDAL's GDALG driver (read-only in GDAL 3.11+).
}
\details{
This function:
\enumerate{
\item Converts the R pipeline to a gdalg S3 object with RFC 104 command string
\item Serializes the GDALG specification to JSON format
\item Writes the JSON to the specified file
}

\strong{GDALG Format:}
The GDALG driver in GDAL 3.11+ is read-only. It can load GDALG JSON files
but cannot write them directly. GDALG JSON is generated using R's yyjsonr
library. The format is well-documented (RFC 104) and stable.

\strong{Output Compatibility:}
Generated GDALG files are:
\itemize{
\item RFC 104 compliant
\item Loadable by GDAL 3.11+ GDALG driver
\item Readable by gdalg_read()
\item Compatible with other GDALG-aware tools
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pipeline <- gdal_raster_reproject(input = "in.tif",
                                  dst_crs = "EPSG:32632") |>
  gdal_raster_scale(src_min = 0, src_max = 100)

if (gdal_has_gdalg_driver()) {
  # Save as native GDALG format
  gdal_save_pipeline_native(pipeline, "workflow.gdalg.json")
}
}

}
