\title{Save GDAL Pipeline Using Native GDALG Format Driver}
\usage{
gdal_save_pipeline_native(pipeline, path, overwrite = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline}{A gdal_pipeline or gdal_job object with pipeline}

\item{path}{Character string specifying output path (typically .gdalg.json)}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites existing file}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints execution details}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path where pipeline was saved
}
\description{
Saves a gdal_pipeline using GDAL's native GDALG format. This method produces
GDALG JSON that is compatible with GDAL's native pipeline format, ensuring
maximum compatibility with other GDAL tools and future versions.
}
\details{
This function requires GDAL 3.11 or later with the GDALG format driver.
It produces GDALG JSON format that can be loaded by GDAL's native tools.

The native GDALG format provides:
\itemize{
\item Compatibility with GDAL Python/C++ APIs
\item Full GDAL version metadata
\item Recognition by other GDAL tools
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pipeline <- gdal_raster_reproject(input = "in.tif", dst_crs = "EPSG:32632") |>
  gdal_raster_convert(output = "out.tif")

if (gdal_has_gdalg_driver()) {
  gdal_save_pipeline_native(pipeline, "workflow.gdalg.json")
}
}

}
