\title{IDE Autocompletion for Dynamic GDAL API}
\usage{
\method{.DollarNames}{GdalApi}(x, pattern = "")

\method{.DollarNames}{GdalApiSub}(x, pattern = "")
}
\description{
S3 methods that enable IDE autocompletion for the dynamic GDAL API.
These methods are called by RStudio, VSCode, and Emacs to provide
tab-completion suggestions when typing \verb{gdal$} or \verb{gdal$raster$}.
}
\details{
The \code{.DollarNames} S3 generic is part of the R autocompletion system.
We implement methods for both GdalApi and GdalApiSub to enable
nested autocompletion at all levels.

\strong{Important:} We avoid calling \code{NextMethod()} to work around a known
RStudio bug with R6 method dispatch in autocompletion context.
