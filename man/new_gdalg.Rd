\usage{
new_gdalg(command_line, type = "gdal_streamed_alg", relative_paths = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{command_line}{Character string. RFC 104 pipeline command.}

\item{type}{Character string. Always "gdal_streamed_alg" for valid specs.}

\item{relative_paths}{Logical. If TRUE (default), paths relative to file.}
}
\value{
A \code{gdalg} S3 object representing the specification.
}
\description{
Encapsulates a pure RFC 104 GDALG (GDAL Algorithm) specification.
A gdalg object represents a GDAL pipeline defined as a command string,
ready for use with GDAL tools or serialization to files.
}
\details{
GDALG is GDAL's standard format for expressing streaming pipeline operations.
It uses RFC 104 command string syntax with step delimiters.

The gdalg format is:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Portable}: Can be used with any GDAL tool that supports GDALG
\item \strong{Minimal}: Contains only the RFC 104 command specification
\item \strong{Standardized}: Compatible with GDAL tools and APIs
}
}
