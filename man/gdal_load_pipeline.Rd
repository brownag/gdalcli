}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string specifying the path to the gdalcli pipeline file}
}
\value{

\description{
Loads a gdal_pipeline from a gdalcli pipeline JSON file. gdalcli pipeline files
can be created by gdal_save_pipeline() and contain pipeline definitions that
can be executed.
}
\details{
Loaded pipelines can be:
\itemize{
\item Executed with gdal_job_run()
\item Modified by piping new jobs
\item Rendered to different formats (native, shell script, etc.)
\item Saved again with gdal_save_pipeline()
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load a previously saved pipeline
pipeline <- gdal_load_pipeline("workflow.gdalcli.json")

# Execute it
gdal_job_run(pipeline)

# Or extend it with additional operations
extended <- pipeline |>
  gdal_raster_scale(src_min = 0, src_max = 100)
}
