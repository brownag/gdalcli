\title{Save GDAL Pipeline to GDALG Format}
\usage{
gdal_save_pipeline(
  pipeline,
  path,
  pretty = TRUE,
  method = c("auto", "native", "json"),
  overwrite = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline}{A gdal_pipeline or gdal_job object with pipeline}

\item{path}{Character string specifying the path to save to (typically .gdalg.json)}

\item{pretty}{Logical. If TRUE (default), formats JSON with indentation for readability}

\item{method}{Character string: "auto" (default), "native", or "json"
\itemize{
\item "auto": Uses native GDALG driver if GDAL 3.11+ with driver available, else custom JSON
\item "native": Forces native GDALG driver (requires GDAL 3.11+)
\item "json": Forces custom JSON serialization
}}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites existing file (used with method="native")}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints diagnostic information}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path where the pipeline was saved
}
\description{
Saves a gdal_pipeline object to a GDALG JSON file. GDALG is GDAL's abstract
pipeline format, which can be saved to disk and loaded later for execution.
}
\details{
This function supports two serialization methods:

\strong{Method: "json" (Custom JSON)}
\itemize{
\item Works with any GDAL version
\item Fast serialization (direct write)
\item gdalcli-specific format
}

\strong{Method: "native" (GDALG Format)}
\itemize{
\item Requires GDAL 3.11+ with GDALG driver
\item Uses GDAL-compatible JSON serialization
\item Universal GDAL compatibility
\item Full GDAL metadata
}

\strong{Method: "auto" (Recommended)}
\itemize{
\item Automatically selects the best method for your system
\item Uses native if available, falls back to JSON
}

The saved GDALG file can be:
\itemize{
\item Executed with GDAL command-line tools
\item Loaded back into R with gdal_load_pipeline()
\item Shared with colleagues or version controlled
\item Used in other GDAL-compatible tools
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pipeline <- gdal_raster_reproject(input = "in.tif", dst_crs = "EPSG:32632") |>
  gdal_raster_convert(output = "out.tif")

# Save to file (auto-detects best method)
gdal_save_pipeline(pipeline, "workflow.gdalg.json")

# Force native GDALG driver
gdal_save_pipeline(pipeline, "workflow_native.gdalg.json", method = "native")

# Force custom JSON
gdal_save_pipeline(pipeline, "workflow_json.gdalg.json", method = "json")

# Load and execute later
loaded <- gdal_load_pipeline("workflow.gdalg.json")
gdal_job_run(loaded)
}

}
