\title{Save GDAL Pipeline to GDALG Format}
\usage{
gdal_save_pipeline(pipeline, path, pretty = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline}{A gdal_pipeline or gdal_job object with pipeline}

\item{path}{Character string specifying the path to save to (typically .gdalg.json)}

\item{pretty}{Logical. If TRUE (default), formats JSON with indentation for readability}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path where the pipeline was saved
}
\description{
Saves a gdal_pipeline object to a GDALG JSON file. GDALG is GDAL's abstract
pipeline format, which can be saved to disk and loaded later for execution.
}
\details{
The saved GDALG file can be:
\itemize{
\item Executed with GDAL command-line tools
\item Loaded back into R with gdal_load_pipeline()
\item Shared with colleagues or version controlled
\item Used in other GDAL-compatible tools
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pipeline <- gdal_raster_reproject(input = "in.tif", dst_crs = "EPSG:32632") |>
  gdal_raster_convert(output = "out.tif")

# Save to file
gdal_save_pipeline(pipeline, "workflow.gdalg.json")

# Load and execute later
loaded <- gdal_load_pipeline("workflow.gdalg.json")
gdal_job_run(loaded)
}

}
