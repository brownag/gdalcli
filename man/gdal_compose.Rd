\title{Compose GDAL Jobs into a Pipeline (Auto-Detecting Raster/Vector)}
\usage{
gdal_compose(jobs = NULL, pipeline = NULL, input = NULL, output = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{jobs}{A list or vector of \code{gdal_job} objects to execute in sequence,
or NULL to use pipeline string}

\item{pipeline}{A pipeline string (ignored if jobs is provided)}

\item{input}{Input dataset path(s)}

\item{output}{Output dataset path}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{gdal_raster_pipeline()} or \code{gdal_vector_pipeline()}}
}
\value{
A \code{gdal_job} object representing the pipeline.
}
\description{
Convenience function that automatically detects whether a composition of jobs contains
raster or vector operations and delegates to the appropriate \code{gdal_raster_pipeline()}
or \code{gdal_vector_pipeline()} function.

This function is useful when you want a single unified interface to compose and process
jobs without needing to explicitly choose the raster or vector variant.

\strong{Note}: This function was previously named \code{gdal_pipeline()}. It was renamed to
\code{gdal_compose()} to avoid conflict with GDAL 3.12+'s native \verb{gdal pipeline} command,
which is available as an auto-generated function. Use \code{gdal_compose()} for gdalcli's
convenient job composition, and the auto-generated \code{gdal_pipeline()} function for
direct access to GDAL's native pipeline command (GDAL 3.12+ only).
}
\details{
The pipeline type is determined by examining the first job's command_path:
\itemize{
\item If the first job is a raster command, \code{gdal_raster_pipeline()} is used
\item If the first job is a vector command, \code{gdal_vector_pipeline()} is used
\item Default is raster if type cannot be determined
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Auto-detect based on job type
job1 <- gdal_raster_reproject(input = "input.tif", dst_crs = "EPSG:32632")
job2 <- gdal_raster_convert(output = "output.tif")

# This will automatically use gdal_raster_pipeline
pipeline <- gdal_compose(jobs = list(job1, job2))
}
